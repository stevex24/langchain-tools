Summary:
This project demonstrates LangChain tool binding and usage with two working examples:
1. Multiply Tool ‚Äì performs arithmetic multiplication by binding a custom tool to an LLM.
2. Weather Tool ‚Äì fetches real-time temperature data from the Open-Meteo API.

Both examples verify tool invocation and integration with ChatOpenAI.  
The console outputs confirm correct operation and tool calls.

Example output:
=== Example 1: Multiply Tool ===
üì£ multiply() called with: a=15, b=23
Tool calls: [ { name: 'multiply', args: { a: 15, b: 23 } } ]
Manual result: 345

=== Example 2: Weather Tool ===
üå§Ô∏è getWeather() called: lat=36.9741, lon=-122.0308
Tool calls: [ { name: 'getWeather', args: { latitude: 36.9741, longitude: -122.0308 } } ]
Manual result: The current temperature is 18¬∞C.

The full project, source code, and README are available in the GitHub repository linked above.
